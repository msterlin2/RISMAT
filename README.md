# RISMAT

This is a repository of python programs useful for Retirement Income Analysis. It is ported from William F Sharpe's Matlab programs associated with his e-book titled "Retirement Income Analysis with scenario matrices". The original [Matlab code and e-textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/RISMAT/) is Licensed as CC BY 4.0, by William F. Sharpe.

Notes:
The programs starting with "smithCase_Chapter11.py" provide charts to analyze various retirement income sources and concepts. They follow the concepts covered in the associated chapter of the book. Note that after each chart is completed, the user must close the chart (press "X") in order to display the subsequent chart (if any).

Programs can be modified to change paramaters that specify scenario attributes and turn on/off charts as desired for custom analysis.
